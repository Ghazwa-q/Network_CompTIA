This lab focuses on upgrading the server’s connection from an Ethernet cable to a Fiber Optic link to enhance its performance and network efficiency.
We are going to use the Cisco Switch. 
'To help determine which cable to use, examine the port types on the Cisco switch (front side) and the server's fiber optic network card (back side).'
